## Introduction
Phishing Domain Detector is a Python-based tool designed to identify and flag potentially malicious domains. Phishing attacks are a significant threat, and this tool aims to provide an additional layer of security by detecting suspicious domains using machine learning algorithms and heuristic techniques.

## Features
- **Domain Analysis:** Analyze domain names to detect phishing attempts.
- **Machine Learning:** Utilize machine learning models for improved accuracy.
- **Heuristic Checks:** Implement heuristic checks to complement ML predictions.
- **Command Line Interface:** Easy-to-use CLI for quick domain checks.
- **Customizable:** Easily extend the tool with additional features and checks.
